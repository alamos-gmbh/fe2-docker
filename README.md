# FE2 Docker

## Important hints
### Support
:de:

**Dieses Projekt / der Betrieb von FE2 als Docker Container ist ein experimentelles Feature, für das keinerlei Support-Anspruch besteht. Wir freuen uns über Bug-Reports die ins Ticket-System eingestellt werden, sollte ein Fehler auffallen. Allerdings besteht kein Anspruch auf Behebung. Darüber hinaus ist es uns leider unmöglich beim Betrieb der Docker-Umgebung zu unterstützen.**

:raising_hand_man: Dieses Projekt richtet sich an professionelle Nutzer mit fundierten Linux / Docker Kenntnissen.

:us:

**This project / running FE2 as docker container is an experimental feature that comes without any support. When a bug is detected we're happy to know about it as a support ticket, but we cannot assist you with running your docker deployments.**

:raising_hand_man: This project addresses professional users with profound Linux and Docker knowledge.

### Environment

Running this containers requires a "real" linux environment (either physical or virtual, see below).

We recommend either a real root server or a "pseudo" root server offering dedicated memory and CPU resources.

Many cheap vServers make use of shared resources and might lead to poor user experience / reliability.

:star: For many years we made good experience with [netcup](https://www.netcup.de/vserver/) and their root server offerings.
They combine the advantages of dedicated root servers with virtual servers. CPU and memory are not shared with other customers, which leads to a very high performance.

Tests were performed on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS

The following versions were installed
- Docker version 20.10.23
- docker-compose version 1.29.2
- git version 2.34.1

:bulb: We recommend running Ubuntu Server

:warning: Docker Desktop for Windows (Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL2)) is not supported.

### Major Upgrades / Minor Upgrades

:warning: Major upgrades are not supported and will lead to errors.
Example:
When a `docker-compose.yml` file specifies version 2.28, it's not supported to upgrade to 2.31 directly by just changing version information.

The upgrade path is:

- 2.28 -> 2.29
- 2.29 -> 2.30
- 2.30 -> 2.31

A major upgrade can also affect the other containers specified in the `docker-compose.yml`file (most likely the mongoDB database version). Before upgrading always check the corresponding git branch of this project. We'll offer compatible environments on release branches, e.g. release/2.28, release/2.29 etc.

:bulb: Upgrades within major releases (aka minor upgrades) are supported, for example:

Upgrading from 2.28.**351** to 2.28.**406** by just changing fe2_app's image version followed by a `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d` is fine.
We'll make sure that these upgrades work flawlessly.

### Using existing Windows configuration
:window: While it **might** work to copy all files from a windows installation over, it's not supported, so please don't ask for help after doing so.

## Start via docker-compose.yml
1. clone the repository to a local folder, e.g. /home/username/docker
2. cd to fe-docker
3. copy config.template/data/logback.xml to data/fe2/config/data/
4. copy docker-compose.yml.template to docker-compose.yml
5. copy or move config.env.example to config.env
6. adjust all variables in config.env
7. Edit the "hostname" property in docker-compose.yml to match your desired hostname. This is important for correct functionality of the system outage function.
8. docker-compose up (-d)

:warning: Do not forget to change the password of the Admin account. This is the first thing to do upon first login to the web interface :warning:

## SSL Configuration

SSL encryption can be enabled by changing the variable CERTBOT_ENABLED (false|true) inside `config.env`

There are two possible options:

### Running without SSL encryption

When `CERTBOT_ENABLED` is set to `false`, the webserver is reachable on port 80 (default, unless changed in `docker-compose.yml`)
Use this scenario for testing and if SSL termination will be handled by another webserver already installed (nginx, traefik, apache, haproxy, etc.)

If port 80 is already in use, another one (not already in use; check with netstat) can be chosen inside `docker-compose.yml`

### Running with SSL encryption enabled

When `CERTBOT_ENABLED` is set to `true`, the webserver is reachable on port 443 (and 80, but http will be redirected to https automatically).

The following prerequisites must be met:

- Unbound ports 80 / 443 locally -> no other process may be running using one of these ports. Check with `netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN | grep -E ':80|:443'`
- :warning: Ports 80 + 443 must not be changed in `docker-compose.yml`, they must be left unchanged, otherwise let's encrypt won't work
- Valid DNS A record pointing to the hosts public IP address, e.g. fe2.meinefeuerwehr.de
- Ports 80 and 443 reachable from outside (port forwarding if required, firewall exception (type TCP), etc.) Although http will be redirected to https when accessing FE2 web interface, port 80 must remain open all the time for let's encrypt (periodic certificate renewal task).

This DNS A record must be configured inside `config.env` file as variable `CERTBOT_DOMAIN`. Moreover a valid email address must be configured for let's encrypt information emails as variable `CERTBOT_EMAIL`.

:warning: Do not enter a dummy address here. Let's encrypt will only send important information.

:hourglass: After starting an SSL enabled FE2 docker instance for the first time, it takes about 15-30 minutes to generate encryption specific parameters (DH parameters). This is normal. The progress can be visualized using `docker logs -f fe2_nginx`

:bulb: During this time, the FE2 web interface won't be accessible.

## Emergency access to the FE2 http port (via 64112)

When you're locked out, emergency access to FE2 is possible via port 64112 after activation in `docker-compose.yml`. Change the line - 64112 to - "64112:64112" (port mapping for the fe2_app service NOT fe2_nginx) save and restart with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

Open a browser of your choice and navigate to http://{DOCKER_HOST_IP}:64112

:bulb: The emergency binding will not use https://

:warning: This exposes port 64112. If no firewall appliance prevents access, the port will be publicly accessible. UFW or iptables firewall does not prevent access (unless explicitly configured, docker bypasses UFW / iptables). More info about that behavior can be found [here](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-fix-the-docker-and-ufw-security-flaw/).

## Backup Scripts
Inside 'scripts/backup' several files can be found to perform backup and restore tasks. A cron example is also contained. Copy all files locally, including 'rsync_ignore.txt'. Afterwards follow the instructions inside the scripts to get started.

:warning: Do not edit the script files in the cloned repository, otherwise they will be overwritten by a future git pull. Always reference (e.g. cron job) the copied and modified files.

## Advanced Usage
Advanced usage / deployment options for professional users. 

:warning: Requires profound knowledge of running docker deployments. 

:bulb: No official support is offered for these use cases. 
### Running multiple containers on same docker host
The following must be configured for multiple FE2 docker containers on the same host:

One possible scenario among others: Create a new directory for each deployment and checkout the git repository to each, then setup the following:

- **Unique activation names:** `config.env`: Use a unique `FE2_ACTIVATION_NAME` variable for each deployment. This is necessary for activation purposes.
- **SSL:** `config.env`: The variable `CERTBOT_ENABLED` must be set to `false` (or at most 1 container is allowed to run with certbot enabled using default ports 80 + 443)
- **Unique container names:** In each `docker-compose.yml` every contained `container_name` declaration must be adjusted to a UNIQUE name, e.g. 
  - fe2_database -> fe2_database_2
  - fe2_app -> fe2_app_2
  - fe2_nginx -> fe2_nginx_2
  
  otherwise `docker-compose up / down` calls will interfere and stop unintended containers. 
  
  Suggestion: Rename every `container_name` inside the first `docker-compose.yml` file to '_1', inside the second compose file to '_2', etc. Check with `docker ps` that all intended containers are running, using the adjusted container names.
- **Unique port combinations:** In each `docker-compose.yml` file, setup a unique port combination, for example:
  - First container: 
    - "80:80" 
    - "443:443"
  - Second container:
    - "81:80" 
    - "444:443"
  - Third container:
    - "82:80"
    - "445:443"
  - etc.

  The left hand side of the port definition must be not already in use by the system (check with netstat; see above), thus in our example the ports 80-82;443-445 must NOT already be used by any process of the system.
